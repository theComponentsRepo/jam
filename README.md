# Jam - the music app

## Team: The Components

## Description

Jam is a music app that allows users to search for songs, add them to a playlist, and listen to them. Due to the nature of the Deezer API, the app is limited to 30 second previews of songs. By default, the home page displays random albums, which provides a good way for users to explore and discover new music. The app is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
